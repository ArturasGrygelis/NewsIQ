    "🧠 Question Answering Graph – LangGraph Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a LangGraph-powered workflow for retrieval-augmented question answering (QA).\n",
    "It orchestrates multiple reasoning and retrieval steps to produce grounded, hallucination-checked answers using a language model and Chroma vector store retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow defines a graph of interconnected nodes, each representing a step in the QA pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize Workflow\n",
    "Prepares the graph state and initializes tracking variables such as steps and question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve Documents\n",
    "Uses the configured retriever (e.g., a Chroma vector store) to fetch the most relevant documents for the given question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade Documents\n",
    "Filters and ranks the retrieved documents using a relevance grader. Only documents that receive a positive grade (e.g., “Yes”, “True”) are kept for answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question Answering\n",
    "Generates an answer to the question using the provided LLM (in this case, ChatGroq with the Gemma2 9B model).\n",
    "The LLM only uses information from the graded documents to ensure grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform Query\n",
    "If the retrieved documents are not relevant enough, the workflow rewrites or reformulates the question to improve retrieval results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer Validation\n",
    "The generated answer is checked against the supporting documents using a hallucination checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "If hallucinations are detected, the answer is regenerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is validated, the workflow ends."

The app is currently available in beta form in the US and France, because that’s where cofounders Robert Lise and Caleb Faruki reside, respectively. If the app does well, more countries should be added soon.\\n\\nThe app arrives during a time of renewed interest in the right-to-repair movement. Through lobbying efforts and consumer advocacy campaigns, right-to-repair folks argue that when somebody buys a piece of technology, they should have the legal right to fix it, replace broken parts, or upgrade it using services, tools, and replacement parts accessed on the open market.\\n\\n“You don't actually own something if you don't have the ability to repair it,” says Lise, the app’s cofounder.\\n\\nIt sounds like a position that doesn’t need much advocacy, but large companies like Apple, Samsung, and John Deere have been resistant to allow their customers to tinker with their products.\\n\\nLise says the goal of The Repair App is to platform businesses and service providers who cover just about anything that can be repaired, from devices like phones and computers to bicycles, clothes, and maybe eventually vehicles. To start, they have reached out to verified repair businesses that they can vet for inclusion in the app.\\n\\nMatt Zieminski, vice president of Repair.org and VP of partnerships at the repair marketplace iFixit, has worked with Lise and the others on the Repair App and says he supports the project. He says that if the app is utilized by enough people, it could make finding options for fixing your stuff easier than it is now.\\n\\nFor example, if you’re searching for repair options on Google, Zieminski says, your local community repair shops might not necessarily come up as one of the top results. Instead, you’re presented with big repair franchises or generic service providers.\\n\\nThe app makes it easy to find independent shops near you. Courtesy of Marine Reliquet; The Repair App\\n\\nThe Repair App will instead show you the shops closest to you that have been vetted by the tech repair experts behind the app.\\n\\n“I think this is really cool,” Zieminski says. ”It is going to level that playing field and allow everybody to find the services they need and then to offer the services to people that may not even know those services exist.”\\n\\nLinking customers to businesses is certainly not a new service. (Remember phonebooks?) Sites like Thumbtack or Angi (formerly Angie’s List) have long acted as repositories for finding handypeople to hire for a variety of tasks. Places like Upwork and Fiverr put a gig-economy spin on the same format. And there are more specific service finder sites like RepairPal, a resource for car repair shops. (RepairPal was bought by Yelp last year.)\"),\n",

CBO provides nonpartisan financial and economic data to lawmakers, and The Washington Post reported that the agency was infiltrated by a “suspected foreign actor.”\\n\\nCBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma told WIRED in a statement that it has “implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems” and that “CBO occasionally faces threats to its network and continually monitors to address those threats.” Emma did not address questions from WIRED about whether the government shutdown has impacted technical personnel or cybersecurity-related work at CBO.\\n\\nWith increasing instability in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) leaving Americans hungry, air traffic control personnel shortages disrupting flights, financial devastation for federal workers, and mounting operational shortages at the Social Security Administration, the shutdown is increasingly impacting every corner of the US. But researchers, former and current government workers, and federal technology experts warn that gaps in foundational activities during the shutdown—things like system patching, activity monitoring, and device management—could have real effects on federal defenses, both now and for years to come.\\n\\n“A lot of federal digital systems are still just running in the cloud throughout the shutdown, even if the office is empty,” says Safi Mojidi, a longtime cybersecurity researcher who previously worked for NASA and as a federal security contractor. “If everything was set up properly, then the cloud offers an important baseline of security, but it's hard to rest easy during a shutdown knowing that even in the best of times there are problems getting security right.”\\n\\nEven before the shutdown, federal cybersecurity workers were being impacted by reductions in force at agencies like the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—potentially hindering digital defense guidance and coordination across the government. And CISA has continued cutting staff during the shutdown as well.\\n\\nIn a statement, spokesperson Marci McCarthy said “CISA continues to execute on its mission” but did not answer WIRED's specific questions about how its work and digital defenses at other agencies have been impacted by the government shutdown, which she blamed on Democrats.\\n\\nThe government's transition to the cloud over the last decade, as well as increased attention to cybersecurity in recent years, does provide an important backstop for a disruption like a shutdown. Experts emphasize, though, that the federal landscape is not homogenous, and some agencies have made more progress and are better equipped than others. Additionally, missed and overlooked digital security work that accumulates during the shutdown will create a backlog when workers return that could be difficult to surmount.\")]"

Through lobbying efforts and consumer advocacy campaigns, right-to-repair folks argue that when somebody buys a piece of technology, they should have the legal right to fix it, replace broken parts, or upgrade it using services, tools, and replacement parts accessed on the open market.\\n\\n“You don't actually own something if you don't have the ability to repair it,” says Lise, the app’s cofounder.\\n\\nIt sounds like a position that doesn’t need much advocacy, but large companies like Apple, Samsung, and John Deere have been resistant to allow their customers to tinker with their products.\\n\\nLise says the goal of The Repair App is to platform businesses and service providers who cover just about anything that can be repaired, from devices like phones and computers to bicycles, clothes, and maybe eventually vehicles. To start, they have reached out to verified repair businesses that they can vet for inclusion in the app.\\n\\nMatt Zieminski, vice president of Repair.org and VP of partnerships at the repair marketplace iFixit, has worked with Lise and the others on the Repair App and says he supports the project. He says that if the app is utilized by enough people, it could make finding options for fixing your stuff easier than it is now.\\n\\nFor example, if you’re searching for repair options on Google, Zieminski says, your local community repair shops might not necessarily come up as one of the top results. Instead, you’re presented with big repair franchises or generic service providers.\\n\\nThe app makes it easy to find independent shops near you. Courtesy of Marine Reliquet; The Repair App\\n\\nThe Repair App will instead show you the shops closest to you that have been vetted by the tech repair experts behind the app.\\n\\n“I think this is really cool,” Zieminski says. ”It is going to level that playing field and allow everybody to find the services they need and then to offer the services to people that may not even know those services exist.”\\n\\nLinking customers to businesses is certainly not a new service. (Remember phonebooks?) Sites like Thumbtack or Angi (formerly Angie’s List) have long acted as repositories for finding handypeople to hire for a variety of tasks. Places like Upwork and Fiverr put a gig-economy spin on the same format. And there are more specific service finder sites like RepairPal, a resource for car repair shops. (RepairPal was bought by Yelp last year.)\"), Document(metadata={'authors': \"['Lily Hay Newman']\", 'language': 'en', 'link': 'https://www.wired.com/story/the-government-shutdown-is-a-ticking-cybersecurity-time-bomb/', 'summary': 'The U.S. Congressional Budget Office reported a hack during a five‑week government shutdown and has added monitoring and security controls, while other agencies like CISA face staff cuts that may hinder cybersecurity efforts.

CBO provides nonpartisan financial and economic data to lawmakers, and The Washington Post reported that the agency was infiltrated by a “suspected foreign actor.”\\n\\nCBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma told WIRED in a statement that it has “implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems” and that “CBO occasionally faces threats to its network and continually monitors to address those threats.” Emma did not address questions from WIRED about whether the government shutdown has impacted technical personnel or cybersecurity-related work at CBO.\\n\\nWith increasing instability in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) leaving Americans hungry, air traffic control personnel shortages disrupting flights, financial devastation for federal workers, and mounting operational shortages at the Social Security Administration, the shutdown is increasingly impacting every corner of the US. But researchers, former and current government workers, and federal technology experts warn that gaps in foundational activities during the shutdown—things like system patching, activity monitoring, and device management—could have real effects on federal defenses, both now and for years to come.\\n\\n“A lot of federal digital systems are still just running in the cloud throughout the shutdown, even if the office is empty,” says Safi Mojidi, a longtime cybersecurity researcher who previously worked for NASA and as a federal security contractor. “If everything was set up properly, then the cloud offers an important baseline of security, but it's hard to rest easy during a shutdown knowing that even in the best of times there are problems getting security right.”\\n\\nEven before the shutdown, federal cybersecurity workers were being impacted by reductions in force at agencies like the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—potentially hindering digital defense guidance and coordination across the government. And CISA has continued cutting staff during the shutdown as well.\\n\\nIn a statement, spokesperson Marci McCarthy said “CISA continues to execute on its mission” but did not answer WIRED's specific questions about how its work and digital defenses at other agencies have been impacted by the government shutdown, which she blamed on Democrats.\\n\\nThe government's transition to the cloud over the last decade, as well as increased attention to cybersecurity in recent years, does provide an important backstop for a disruption like a shutdown. Experts emphasize, though, that the federal landscape is not homogenous, and some agencies have made more progress and are better equipped than others. Additionally, missed and overlooked digital security work that accumulates during the shutdown will create a backlog when workers return that could be difficult to surmount.\")], 'steps': ['Graph Initialization', 'retrieve_documents', 'grade_document_retrieval', 'generate_answer', 'Check for hallucinations'], 'selected_documents': [Document(metadata={'authors': \"['Michael Calore', 'Will Knight', 'Kylie Robison']\", 'language': 'en', 'link': 'https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-move-aside-chatbots-ai-humanoids-are-here/', 'summary': 'OpenAI is ramping up its robotics efforts by hiring researchers to develop AI systems for humanoid robots, which are becoming less clumsy and more capable.
