    "## ⚙️ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as a stateful graph of modular nodes, each performing a distinct step in the summarization pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize Workflow\n",
    "Sets up the workflow state, including input parameters such as the website URL, steps tracker, and generation counters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scrape Article\n",
    "Retrieves raw webpage content (text, metadata, and structure) from the specified website_address.\n",
    "This stage ensures clean and usable text data for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summarize Article\n",
    "Uses an LLM (Gemma2 9B via ChatGroq) to create an informative, structured summary of the scraped content.\n",
    "Additionally, the model extracts key topics to enrich metadata and improve vector-based retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grade Summary vs. Article\n",
    "The generated summary is validated for factual alignment with the original article using a hallucination checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "If hallucinations are detected → the summarization step repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no hallucinations are found → the workflow proceeds to storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add to Chroma\n",
    "The validated summary and metadata (topics, source, and title) are stored in a Chroma vector store for future use in retrieval-augmented question-answering workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM:\n",
    "ChatGroq with the model \"openai/gpt-oss-20b\" (Gemma2 9B equivalent) provides deterministic and fact-consistent summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorstore:\n",
    "A Chroma database that persists structured document embeddings, enabling efficient semantic retrieval for later QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph State Machine:\n",
    "Implements the workflow logic with StateGraph, allowing for iterative validation (re-summarization on hallucinations) and clear state tracking."

      "Summary: China’s national cyber defense agency, CVERC, alleges that the U.S. government was involved in the 2020 LuBian mining‑pool hack that stole 127,272 BTC (≈$14.5 billion). The report claims the U.S. had custody of the stolen coins for over a year before formally filing a forfeiture, and that the dormancy of the funds suggests a state‑orchestrated operation rather than ordinary hacking. The case adds a geopolitical dimension to one of the largest crypto thefts ever recorded....\n",

CBO provides nonpartisan financial and economic data to lawmakers, and The Washington Post reported that the agency was infiltrated by a “suspected foreign actor.”\\n\\nCBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma told WIRED in a statement that it has “implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems” and that “CBO occasionally faces threats to its network and continually monitors to address those threats.” Emma did not address questions from WIRED about whether the government shutdown has impacted technical personnel or cybersecurity-related work at CBO.\\n\\nWith increasing instability in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) leaving Americans hungry, air traffic control personnel shortages disrupting flights, financial devastation for federal workers, and mounting operational shortages at the Social Security Administration, the shutdown is increasingly impacting every corner of the US. But researchers, former and current government workers, and federal technology experts warn that gaps in foundational activities during the shutdown—things like system patching, activity monitoring, and device management—could have real effects on federal defenses, both now and for years to come.\\n\\n“A lot of federal digital systems are still just running in the cloud throughout the shutdown, even if the office is empty,” says Safi Mojidi, a longtime cybersecurity researcher who previously worked for NASA and as a federal security contractor. “If everything was set up properly, then the cloud offers an important baseline of security, but it's hard to rest easy during a shutdown knowing that even in the best of times there are problems getting security right.”\\n\\nEven before the shutdown, federal cybersecurity workers were being impacted by reductions in force at agencies like the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—potentially hindering digital defense guidance and coordination across the government. And CISA has continued cutting staff during the shutdown as well.\\n\\nIn a statement, spokesperson Marci McCarthy said “CISA continues to execute on its mission” but did not answer WIRED's specific questions about how its work and digital defenses at other agencies have been impacted by the government shutdown, which she blamed on Democrats.\\n\\nThe government's transition to the cloud over the last decade, as well as increased attention to cybersecurity in recent years, does provide an important backstop for a disruption like a shutdown. Experts emphasize, though, that the federal landscape is not homogenous, and some agencies have made more progress and are better equipped than others. Additionally, missed and overlooked digital security work that accumulates during the shutdown will create a backlog when workers return that could be difficult to surmount.\"),\n",
